# java-katas
programming katas in java to exercise TDD, OO, pair programming and other software development practices

## pair programming
development is done in pairs, with devs taking the roles of a driver and a co-pilot. following the analogy, the driver is in control
of the keyboard and does most of the coding; whereas the co-pilot takes a strategical role by helping the driver decide what
should be the next path to explore. roles ought be interchanged every so often but it's not mandatory. effective pair programming should
bring the following benefits:

- improved code quality
- knowledge sharing of code base
- driver and co-pilot can learn from each others' expertise
- reduction of slacking (not a textbook answer)

although there are also downsides:

- cost (there's only one person typing)

to achieve effective pair programming as a driver remember to:

- do not rush with the coding, pair programming is not a demonstration of coding
- speak out your thoughts to make it easier for the co-pilot to follow through
- when you get stuck, stop and discuss with your co-driver possible solutions

to achieve effective pair programming as a co-pilot remember to:

- not fallback into the trap of disconnecting from the exercise
- question the driver's decisions when you don't understand them, suggest improvements
- do some thinking ahead, the driver is both coding and speaking out their thoughts whereas you're just thinking
