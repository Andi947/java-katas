# multiplayer bowling game kata

The goal of this kata is to reinforce your knowledge on some of Java's common data structures while practicing TDD. For this we'll re-use the code from a previous exercise.

We already have the code to play a bowling game, but only by ourselves, and that's rather boring. Extend the functionality to allow for
multiple players to play together.

1. Allow multiple players to roll pins and to retrieve their score sheets

2. Players that are not in the game are not allowed to roll pins - throw an InvalidPlayerException in such a case
